Choices are hard. You might think to have too few options, with a lot of things seeming to be out of your league. However, more often than not you have too many options to choose from. You’ve probably been told that you can do (almost) anything. But that doesn’t mean you can do everything. You can only spend your time once. In a world of possibilities, how do you choose?

Looking back at some of the major choices I've made in the past, I’ve tended to choose options that seem safe, comfortable and/or give a sense of flexibility. It seems obvious that having options in the future is a good thing. But having more options doesn’t make it easier for you to decide. On the flip side, you could also argue that it’s postponing your decisions. As time keeps ticking away, not making a deliberate choice is a choice as well. And if you stay completely flexible others will make your choices for you. If you commit yourself you make a stand.

So then, when should you commit yourself to something and when should you widen your perspective?

## Dabble to explore potential interests

I’ve noticed that too often my mind creates an idealised image of a novel undertaking, be it studies, career, sports, hobbies or relationships. Images shaped by the information you gather from other people’s romanticised successes. You see the end goal without the process. Only when you actually try and do it, you start experiencing it for what it really is.

So it's better to test the waters first. Explore what options lie out there for you. Diverge before you converge. Know that finding out that you don’t enjoy something isn't lost time but valuable knowledge. You’re one step closer to something you actually like.

It's also perfectly fine to just do something for the sake of passing time. If it brings you joy, relaxation or something else positive, that is worth something and thus not wasted. In the end, you decide how to spend your time and you shouldn’t even want to be productive all the time.

What helped me in this exploration:

1. Immerse yourself in a variety of topics. Follow your curiosity. Question your assumptions and beliefs. If something sparks your attention, go and have a look. You could start by asking yourself some of these questions [(from Jordan Gross)](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/how-to-find-your-passion-in-life-a283afc606aa):
   - What kinds of articles, videos or people grasp my attention?
   - What would I like to do more of?
   - What did I enjoy doing as a child?
   - If I had zero preparation for a 30-minute assessment in which all I had to do was talk about one topic, what topic would I choose?

2. Perform low-stakes experiments that are easy to do, time efficient and cheap. Gather information and experience about what it would be like to actually pursue the thing. Preferably it’s a combination of online, real world and social sources. You can think of:
   - Do a workshop, participate in a relevant meeting group for a session, join a (free) tryout lesson for a sport or study.
   - Follow an online course, watch some youtube tutorials or read a couple of blogs on the topic. Put the things you learn into practice as soon as possible to experience it itself. Depending on what you’re trying out, it can for instance be in your work or in a personal project.
   - Talk to people that are doing what you would like to undertake. They don't have to be the world’s best, but just a bit further in their journey that you are at that moment. Ask about their experiences and hardships to get a sense of what your journey could look like. 

3. After a couple of experiments, evaluate your experiences:
   - Do you enjoy the process, regardless of your talent, aptitude or success in it?
   - How involved would you like to be? What do you want to be able to do with it? Do you see it as an occasional fling, a hobby, a professional career, or something in between?
   - Can or do you want to combine it with something you are already pursuing?

## Commit for growth

There also is a time for commitment. It might seem daunting, as there is always an opportunity cost involved with your choices. Time, money and effort spent on one thing cannot be spent elsewhere. But know that it’s not the end, as you are always free to adjust your course along the way.

What does commitment bring? I see it as a contract for growth, agreed upon with oneself. It brings clarity, consistency and confidence to the things you do and the choices you make.

Worthwhile commitment should not be about an end goal necessarily, but focus on your enjoyment of the process (the journey). Only when you focus on the process you can start to define your own success, independent of other people’s approval.

### Clarity

If you leave too many options open, it’s very hard to effectively allocate your time and resources. You can still learn and find joy, but if you want to make any progress it’s way more effective to choose a direction and keep at it.

Clarity gives you focus and certainty in decision-making. With your course set, you don’t have to think and doubt as much whenever you get to a crossroads.

The clarity of commitment is not only in deciding what you want to pursue, but even more in explicitly defining what to avoid spending time on. We care about a great number of things, but struggle to prioritize. Low priority or inessential things will distract you from the important progress you want to make. Warren Buffet’s [‘two lists’ process of elimination](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus) is a nice way to separate these:

1. Make a list of the top 25 skills/dreams/things you want to pursue (for a specified timeline).
2. Review the list and circle your top five.
3. You now have a list of your circled items, those will be your goals. The other twenty have just become your things to avoid at all costs. Well, at least until you have succeeded in your top five.

### Consistency

You commit to something to improve. Maybe it doesn’t take you ten thousand hours to get where you want to go, but at the least it requires a significant amount of deliberate practice and learning.

Commitment holds us accountable to put in the consistent work. It’s in our psyche to not want to disappoint ourselves. To prevent this from happening, we motivate ourselves to make the right choices and to do the practice. The longer our streak of succes, the more we are motivated to keep it going.

Here it can also help to share your commitment publicly, and make yourself accountable to others. In this way you use social risks to aid you in your consistency.

### Confidence

As you commit to the process, your success is in the act of doing the work, not in the results. With this practice, more and more you start to believe that you have and are improving the capacities to succeed, building your confidence.

If you stop worrying about the outcome, you also stop worrying about other people’s opinions. Nothing will ever be perfect. Confidence helps you to see when things are good enough. You give it your all and see where it leads.

Value is created in the public, not when it stays in your head or on your computer. Sharing gives you an opportunity to provide value and to receive it as well. You are getting feedback from the world that aids in your growth.

## Balancing out commitment and exploration

I’m all in for exploration and experimentation, especially in the first few decades of your life. That doesn’t mean you stop as soon as you turn thirty, but after all this inquiry some things probably have come out on top. These are the ones you should invest in for the long term.

It’s also good to realize that the world will keep changing and you will change as well as a consequence. Life is long. Your interests and desires can change. But there is enough time to grow in a couple of things and pursue multiple passions. If they complement each other, do it in parallel. The most interesting and innovative outcomes come from making unconventional combinations of skills and topics.

Given all this, you have to find a balance between dabbling and committing that works for you. Periodic reflection is your biggest aid in this balancing exercise. It helps you to celebrate your wins, learn from your mistakes, to look ahead and to correct your course if needed.

What works for me is a combination of a weekly and a quarterly reflection plus goal setting. A period of three months is large enough to make significant progress, but still small enough to be able to grasp effectively and give a focussed outline. Subsequently, weekly reviews can break this outline into manageable tasks and activities to execute.

After primarily dabbling for quite some years, I’ve lately started to shift my equilibrium.
I’ve learned that passion or purpose isn’t something you find. It’s something you create and grow in the process.

What I have found so far is that I want to follow my insatiable curiosity to understand the world a tiny bit better every day. So I’m committing to that.

I’m committing to developing skills that help me learn and understand. That help me create and [make me more resilient](https://www.lxvdo.com/posts/building-resilience).

And I’m committing to nurturing connections. To relationships that give color and value to life.

For the foreseeable future I’m publishing at least one piece of content a week. I’ll be dabbling in different topics along the way. Some pieces will be bad, some okay and some might even be good. That’s all part of the process, the pains of growing.

Let’s get going.
